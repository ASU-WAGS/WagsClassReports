# Wags Class Reports

Built for end of semester WAGS reports

Not built for speed or security, if you would like to do that you're welcome to it. I was just tired of doing all the calculations by hand. 

###Steps:

* Login to each account and download the student review 
 - Admin -> Review Problems -> Download CSV
* Compile and run the program
* Give it the path to the file
* Give it a title
* It will generate a CSV file for you with _Calculated appended to the end
